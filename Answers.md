Ans 1    The product table and product_category table has one to many relationship.A product category can have multiple products associated with it, but each product belongs to only one category. This relationship is often modeled in a relational database using foreign keys, as in this case with the "category_id" attribute in the "Product" entity.
In summary, the "Product_Category" entity serves as a way to organize and classify products into different categories, while the "Product" entity represents individual products, each of which is associated with a specific category through the "category_id" foreign key attribute.
Ans 2  We can define a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. This constraint ensures that the value entered into the "category_id" column must exist in the primary key column of the "Product_Category" table.
